The objective of this project is to create a React app that allows the user to click a button and 
create a magical item that can be used in 5E Dungeons and Dragons.

I aim to cement my understanding of React and bring what I have been learning at School of Code to this project.

A rough plan with a few simple objectives to start that.

Step 1
- Create a folder for my components, and files for each component
- Create a title component
- Create button component

Step 1 attempted:
Cant seem to create a button component alone, I had to add it to
the "Heading" component. 
Added a console.log when clicked which makes me wonder a few things;
I want each button to do a different thing. Do I need to write a 
response for each button? Would it be better to have (and make work)
a seperate component for each button?
TO COMPLETE STEP 1
-Research buttons within react with jsx
-Decide whether to go for component buttons or not.

PROGRESS MADE: (Step 1 complete)
I have seperated out each button, it seems like the smart thing 
to do in terms of reusability etc.
-Added handleClick function and hooked up the Name button to generate a random 
number when clicked

Step 2
-Currently can generate a random number when name button is clicked - do that for
 all buttons
-Get the random number to show in the <li></li>
-Once the random number shows, research how to access the nameArray and display that 
in place of the random number
-As a note, the random number was a test to make sure the onClick was handled properly
-More thoughts, should the <li> be a seperate component?!


So. Hackathon gave a lot of insight into how React works with state etc. 
Led me to conclude that it is possible to do what I want to do, but I will
need to plan it out properly and have a better understanding of what I am trying 
to do at each stage.
(as a side note, really struggled with the Hackathon despite it being
kinda simple in its aims. Conceptually, I think I understand but I am 
too dumb to know exactly how I can do this sort of thing).

Plan 2:

What files/components do I need?
-index.js that renders App
-app.js that takes in components and are exported in App()

Component List:
-Button Component. Triggers onlick event
