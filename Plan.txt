The objective of this project is to create a React app that allows the user to click a button and 
create a magical item that can be used in 5E Dungeons and Dragons.

I aim to cement my understanding of React and bring what I have been learning at School of Code to this project.

A rough plan with a few simple objectives to start that.

Step 1
- Create a folder for my components, and files for each component
- Create a title component
- Create button component

Step 1 attempted:
Cant seem to create a button component alone, I had to add it to
the "Heading" component. 
Added a console.log when clicked which makes me wonder a few things;
I want each button to do a different thing. Do I need to write a 
response for each button? Would it be better to have (and make work)
a seperate component for each button?
TO COMPLETE STEP 1
-Research buttons within react with jsx
-Decide whether to go for component buttons or not.
